/**

 * I always thought that my old friend John was rather richer than he looked, but I never knew exactly how much money he actually had.
 * One day (as I was plying him with questions) he said: "Imagine I have between m and n Zloty (or did he say Quetzal? I can't remember!)

If I were to buy 9 cars costing c each, I'd only have 1 Zlotty (or was it Meticals?) left.

And if I were to buy 7 boats at b each, I'd only have 2 Ringglets (or was it Zlotty?) left.

Could you tell me in each possible case:

how much money f he could possibly have
the cost c of a car
the cost b of a boat?

So, I will have a better idea about his fortune. Note that if m-n is big enough, you might have a lot of possible answers.

Each answer will be given as ["M: f", "B: b", "C: c"] and all the answers as [ ["M: f", "B: b", "C: c"] ... ]. M stands for "Money", B for boats, C for cars.

m and n are positive or null integers with m <= n or m >= n, m and n inclusive.
